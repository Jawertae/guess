#Guess

###A Guessing Game

This is a game for people who don't know numbers but wanna guess them.

It's fun.

Trust me.

##Premise

A random number is generated from 0 to 10.
You have 10 guesses to get it right.

Think that's easy?
*it is*

But now you have 10 guesses between 0 and 20.

Everytime you guess correctly, the upper limit doubles.

##Difficulty

The mode describedis **classic** mode.

We provide several difficulties:
* Easy
    - Ridiculously easy mode where after each round, you gain an additional guess and the median is shown.
* Medium
    - Slightly harder mode where you only gain an additional guess every 5 rounds and you dont see the median
* Hard (Classical)
    - No limits or median is shown. Only 10 guesses no matter what.

##Planned

* Insanity Mode! (now with negative numbers)
